== How to setup sunrise alarm (sunrise-like wakeup)

. Enable _Settings -> Services -> Smartlight -> Use smartlight_
. Select your smartlight:
* Use phone's screen as a smartlight: Enable _Smartlight -> Use screen light_
* Use a smartbulb as a smartlight: Connect using _Smartlight -> Philips HUE, IKEA Tr책dfri (disconnected)_
* Use Sleep Phaser as a smartlight: Connect using _Smartlight -> Sleep Phaser (disconnected)_ and enable _Smartlight_ right under it.
* Use cable-type Sleep Mask as a smartlight: Connect using _Smartlight -> Use Sleep Mask_.

After you've done the above steps to connect and enable the smartlight of your choice, all of your alarms will turn on the smartlight when they start ringing. Now, to have a truly sunrise wakeup, you probably want the smartlight to turn on _before_ the alarm rings.

To set that up, head to _Settings -> Alarms -> Sound delay_ and set it to some period. At the time of the alarm, only the smartlight will turn on at the lowest brightness and gradually brighten up until the set period passes. Then the alarm starts ringing.

Without the delayed sound start, you can control the speed of sun-rise effect by changing the period of <</alarm/alarm_settings/gentle_alarm#,Gentle volume increase>>. The longer the period is, the longer it takes to get from dark to full light.


[EXAMPLE]
*Sunrise alarm with delayed sound* - start of the alarm sound is set for 3 minutes = the light level will start increasing from alarm time, till the start of the sound. So after 3 minutes, the smart lights will be at the highest brightness. Duration of gentle volume increase does not play any role.
*Sunrise alarm with gentle volume increase, sound not delayed* - gentle volume increase is set to 24 minutes = the light level will start increase from alarm time, and it will take 24 minutes to reach the highest brightness.
