== How to set up integration in Tools app

The Tools app is ready to use with Sleep app, you do not need to enable the integration.

== How to set up integration in Sleep app

. Open _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Wearables -> Use wearable_.
. Choose the correct option from the list.
. For HR data enable _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Wearable -> Heart rate monitoring_.

NOTE: Sleep tracking collects data the whole night and they are analyzed in real-time. This means the watch must stay connected with BT during sleep tracking.

== HR monitoring

Check your HR settings in the Mi Fit app.
When the Mi Band is in *Sleep Assistant* HR mode in Mi Fit, it doesn’t feed the HR data to Mi Band Tools / Sleep as Android. When it is in regular HR tracking mode (24-hour), it works.

. Enable _Heart Rate Monitor_ in T&MB _Left_ ☰ _menu -> Heart Rate_ -> icon:ic_cog[] -> _Heart Rate monitor_
