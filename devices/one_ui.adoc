Sleep tracking with Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 5 (running the ONE UI Watch OS) requires a companion app installed from the Play Store on the watch.

NOTE: Unfortunately due to limit put for non-Samsung apps, we cannot read SpO2 or HRV from those watches at the moment.

== How to set up

.On the watch
. Make sure the watch is connected to the phone.
. Go to app list on your watch, select Play Store.
. Find *Sleep as Android* and select _Install_.

.On the phone
. After the companion app is installed, you can enable the connection in _Settings -> Wearables -> Use wearable -> Galaxy Watch 4+_.
. Test the connection in Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Test sensor - you should see a graph reacting to your movement (a short delay is normal, data are sent in batches).
. For HR data, enable *Heart rate monitoring* in _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Wearables -> Heart rate monitoring_.

NOTE: Make sure the sleep tracking activity is allowed in the background within Wear app in _Galaxy Wear > Watch settings > Apps > Sleep tracking > Allow background activity_.
