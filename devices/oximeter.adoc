## What it does
Oximeter monitors your oxygen and heart rate levels. You need a compatible device - https://happyelectronics.eu/products/alert-stresslocator-oximeter[oximeter], or there are few wearables that allow us collecting SpO~2~ data too. See <</sleep/breath_rate#,Breath rate detection and oxygenation measure docs>> for details.

The compatible oximeters are Berrymed oximeters with custom firmware. We did try a lot of oximeters that are on the market and these had the most reliable data.

Currently, only some Wear OS powered wearables can be used for SpO~2~ monitoring. Garmins and Galaxy watches are hopefully coming soon.

NOTE: We have tested TicWatch 3. If you have Wear OS watch that can monitor SpO2, but this data are not collect by Sleep, please send us your application log (Left â˜° menu -> (?) Support -> Report a bug) and we will use the information from the log for adding support for this watch too.


## Where to find it

## Guide

### How to set up oximeter
. Turn on your oximeter
.. If you have an older (non-BTLE) oximeter, pair it with your phone using the system bluetooth settings.
.. If you have a newer (BTLE) oximeter, do not pair it.
. Connect the oximeter to the app by tapping _Settings -> Wearables -> Pulse oximeter (Bluetooth)_

Now when you start sleep tracking, Sleep will connect to your oximeter to gather SpO~2~ and HR data.

### How to set up wearable

. Make sure the wearable is connected properly, and corresponding option is enabled in _Settings -> Wearables -> Use wearable_.
. Enable SpO2 data gathering in _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Wearables -> Pulse oximeter (Wear Os...)_.
