## Get a compatible Pulse Oximeter

[horizontal]
*link:https://happyelectronics.eu/products/alert-stresslocator-oximeter[Buy Pulse Oximeter]*:: Get a Pulse Oximeter compatible with Sleep as Android and suitable for whole night oxygenation monitoring link:https://happyelectronics.eu/products/alert-stresslocator-oximeter[HERE].

Oximeter monitors your oxygen and heart rate levels. You need a compatible device - https://happyelectronics.eu/products/alert-stresslocator-oximeter[oximeter], or there are few wearables that allow us collecting SpO~2~ data too. See <</sleep/breath_rate#,Breath rate detection and oxygenation measure docs>> for details.

The compatible oximeters are BerryMed oximeters with custom firmware. We did try a lot of oximeters that are on the market and these had the most reliable data.

Alternatively, you can use wearables with SpO~2~ sensors. But due to restrictions on OEMs side only some Wear OS devices with freely accessible SpO~2~ sensors can be used for SpO~2~ monitoring with Sleep as Android. This includes for instance some Mobvoi Tic Watch devices, some Fossil models. We are able to get some SpO~2~ data from Garmins devices but probably not a sontinuous stream we would need to Respiratory disturbance analysis.

NOTE: We are testing Mobvoi TicWatch 3 Pro and SpO~2~ monitoring works very well there. If you have Wear OS watch that can monitor SpO~2~, but this data are not collect by Sleep, please send us your application log (Left â˜° menu -> (?) Support -> Report a bug) and we will use the information from the log for adding support for this watch too.

NOTE: Continuous SpO~2~ monitoring on Samsung Galaxy Watches is currently not possible due to limitations on Samsung side.

## Where to find it

## Guide

### How to set up oximeter
. Turn on your oximeter
.. If you have an older (non-BTLE) oximeter, pair it with your phone using the system bluetooth settings.
.. If you have a newer (BTLE) oximeter, do not pair it.
. Connect the oximeter to the app by tapping _Settings -> Wearables -> Pulse oximeter (Bluetooth)_

Now when you start sleep tracking, Sleep will connect to your oximeter to gather SpO~2~ and HR data.

### How to set up wearable

. Make sure the wearable is connected properly, and corresponding option is enabled in _Settings -> Wearables -> Use wearable_.
. Enable SpO2 data gathering in _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Wearables -> Pulse oximeter (Wear Os...)_.
