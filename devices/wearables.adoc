== How to set up tracking with a wearable

. First of all, make sure your wearable is supported (see the <</devices/supported_wearable#, table of all integated wearables>>).
. Check if the wearable is connected properly via Bluetooth.
. Install the required companion apps - this depends on the wearable type, check the  <</devices/supported_wearable#, table below>>, or one of the subpages.
. Select the corresponding option in _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Wearables -> Use wearable_.
. You can test the connection on some wearables with the Test sensor - see <</devices/test_sensor#, details about testing the connection here>>.

You can find specific guides for each wearable type on the subpages of the Wearable section.

NOTE: Sleep tracking collects data the whole night and the data are analyzed in real-time. This means the watch must stay connected with BT during sleep tracking.


== Create an alarm only as vibrations on watch (no sound, delayed sound)

. Set the alarm silent (_<<per-alarm,Alarm-specific settings>> -> Sound -> Silent_) or set the delay on sound (_Settings -> Alarms -> Sound delay_).
. Enable wearable vibrations (_Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Wearables -> Vibrate_).

NOTE: We highly recommend to set a sound delay instead of setting the alarm silent, especially when backup alarm is silent too.
