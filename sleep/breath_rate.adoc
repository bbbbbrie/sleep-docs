*Makes use of sensors that can measure either your breath rate (<</sleep/sensors#sonar, sonar>>,  <</devices/sleep_phaser_2#, Sleep phaser>>, and https://sleep.urbandroid.org/polar-sleep-tracking/[Polar H10]), or your blood oxygenation (<</devices/oximeter#, oximeter, some wearables>>).*


A *turquoise line* on your sleep graph shows breath rate - see <<breath-line>>.
A *blue line* on your graph depicts oxygen data - see <<spo2-graph>>.

Whenever a significant dip in value occurs, a O2 symbol icon:ic_action_cpap[] will be shown in the graph. This is a _breathing disturbance_. From those disturbances, we compute your <<RDI>> value. Monitoring breathing disturbances is important for link:https://sleep.urbandroid.org/sleep-apnea-pulse-oximetry/[sleep apnea] detection.

== RDI
*Respiratory Disturbance Index* is the average count of respiratory disturbance episodes per hour.
E.g. if you stop breathing once per every hour of your sleep, RDI would be 1.

[horizontal]
0 - 10:: RDI under 10 is considered normal, some of the disturbance events measure may be faults of the sensor and how tight the sensor is around your finger for instance.
10 - 15:: RDI from 10 to 15 is considered a mild respiratory disturbance. We strongly recommend to do the measurements repeatedly to minimize any errors in measurement
15 - 30:: RDI from 15 to 30 is considered moderate respiratory disturbance. It can be a warning sign. Definitely do measurement repeatedly to verify this result.
30 and more:: RDI over 30 is considered severe. We recommend to consult your doctor.


== Sonar breath rate tracking

Sonar can measure your abdominal movements and thus estimate your breath rate, if the signal is strong enough. With the <</sleep/sensors#sonar, Sonar>>, no actions is required - you will automatically see breath rates on your sleep graph.

== Sleep phaser breath rate tracking

<</devices/sleep_phaser_2#, Sleep phaser>> can also measure your abdominal movements for estimating your breath rate.
No actions is required - you will automatically see breath rates if the overall setting in your bedroom and the device in use reach the required level of sensitivity.

== Oximeter SpO2 monitoring
By using <</devices/oximeter#, Oximeter>> or wearable, we can track blood oxygenation levels (SPO2) directly. Oximeters provide a better - more precise - respiratory issues tracking. They can even hint on some severe issues such as the link:https://sleep.urbandroid.org/sleep-apnea-pulse-oximetry/[Sleep apnea].

_Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Wearables -> Pulse oximeter (Bluetooth)_

== Wearables SpO2 monitoring

Reads SpO2 data from a wearable connected in <</devices/wearables/wearable_setup#, Use wearable>>.

_Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Wearables -> Pulse oximeter (Wear OS, Garmin..)_

WARNING: Not all wearables provide SpO2 data to our app. Check the <</devices/supported_wearable#, compatibility table>>.


== Low breath rate alarm

If enabled, this will wake you up if you have a low breathing rate (or blood oxygen level) for a while. You can configure the sound, vibrations, or both.

_Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Wearbales -> Low breath rate alarm_

WARNING: The alert is very prominent on purpose.
