== General description
Advice watches recent trends in the main sleep dimensions (Duration, Irregularity, Deep sleep %, Snoring, Social jet-lag...).

In most cases it compares your last 60 days aggregates to the last 7 days aggregates and look for significant recent worsening or improvements.

For some dimensions there are further checks, such as whether your data are within bounds set by public health studies.
//
//For some dimensions there are checks to be within bounds set by public medical studies.
//
//Advice also looks at your tags and tells you when there is an increased occurrence of e.g. #alcohol as a caution or #sport as good trend.
//
//Advice also compares your sleep figures with the average data measured by the app for your peers in your country.
