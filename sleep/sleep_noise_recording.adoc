You can check whether the phone is recording on the sleep tracking screen - [color-red]#red ⬤# indicates that the phone is currently recording.

On the seek bar to the right you can see current volume level and your _Recording volume threshold_ which indicates volume to start recording.

NOTE: In order to achieve good recordings, keep the phone close to the sound source with the microphone area clear.

WARNING: The sleep noise recording might not work on Android 11, when the tracking is started automatically due to changes in the permissions - apps running in the background cannot ask for the mic.
To workaround this we would need to have the "Draw over other apps permission" and start a transparent short lived screen before we start the sleep tracking service.
Please see the history of the issue here:
https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/162913367

NOTE: Enabling Sleep noise recording may lead to higher battery consumption during sleep tracking.

== Sound recognition
Enables recognition of individual sounds (snoring, talk, coughing, laughter, baby cry). See <</sleep/sound_recognition#,Sound recognition>>.

== Anti-snoring
Sets anti-snoring cues to make you stop snoring. See <</sleep/anti-snoring#,Anti-snoring>>.

== Record sleep noises
Recording is triggered when a characteristic sound (snoring, talk, coughing, laughter, baby cry) is detected or when _Recording volume threshold_ is reached.

== Recording volume threshold

The volume at which the app starts recording. The good value is usually around 20-30% (may vary with device).

[EXAMPLE]
1% threshold = app will try to record all sounds, because almost any sound now matches the criteria
100% threshold = only a few really loud sounds match the criteria for triggering the recorder


[horizontal]
== Noise statistics
If enabled, you will be seeing noise level statistics under each sleep records. Cannot be disabled if _Record snoring, sleep talk_ is enabled.

== Storage path
A path to your recordings saved on your device.

== Automatic delete
If enabled, all unstarred recordings will be deleted after 7 days.

== Output
Allows you to switch between .m4a and .ogg formats.

== Input
Options for different pre-processing of sound signal from the mic (for debugging issues with noise cancellation, handling calls, etc.)

== Guides

=== How to play your recordings
You can play your recordings from three places within the app.

==== Play sound from Noise section in the Left ☰ menu

* All your available recordings are stored in the _Left_ ☰ _menu -> Noise_.
* You can filter snore / talk tagged files with the search bar.

==== Play sound directly from the graph
* A period on the graph with sound recording is marked with icon:ic_action_mic[] icon.
* When you drag over the graph period with mic icon and select the period (it will be highlighted).
* You can play the sound recorded at that time with icon:ic_action_play[] in the top right corner.
