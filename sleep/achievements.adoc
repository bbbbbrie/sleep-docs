Sleep Achievements are reward badges for your accomplishments and milestones, representing your progress. They give you something to strive for. You can collect them all, and share your accomplishments with your friends.

To get started with Achievements, you can either tap on the Achievement card on the Dashboard, or open the section from the Left â‰¡ menu.

Each Achievement requires you to complete certain goals (sleeping enough hours, getting to the bed earlier) to earn points. After you gather enough points, you will earn one of the badges (Bronze, Gold, Diamond).

Tapping on the card will guide you to the feature settings, or to the related <</sleep/goals#goal_start, Goal creation page>> - unless you already have one goal running (we support only one goal at a time).
