*Sleep score is a complete summary of your sleep health.*

Sleep score draws a lot of inspiration from the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Sleep_Quality_Index[Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index].

NOTE: You can choose between colors matching your theme, or color-coding - each dimension has its own color across the whole app (_Settings > Personalize > Stats > Color palette_).


If you see you are consistently behind some target for any of your dimensions, you can setup <</sleep/goals,goals>>. For instance you are sleeping just 6:00 on average which is quite bad for an adult, so you can setup a goal to increase your sleep duration to at least 6:30 and the app will guide you gradually to achieve that goal...
The app will point out some notable trends and also suggest some changes in the <<sleep/advice,Advice section>>.

== Sleep score dimensions

There are eight dimensions that contribute to sleep quality. Each of the dimensions has a healthy range and an unhealthy range.
The app combines all dimensions into one "Sleep Score" for simplification (only new version).

[NOTE]
====
[[note-age]]
Healthy durations are adjusted according to your age as defined in _Settings -> Stats -> Year of birth_

* General or not set (6.5 - 9)
* School age (9 - 11)
* Teenager (8 - 10),
* Young (7 - 9)
* Elderly (6 - 9)

If you’re in the healthy range for a certain dimension, it lights up green and you get one point. Every line can also turn red if the values are in a very unfavourable range.

NOTE: If you are missing some charts, it means you do not have the required sensor, or the app does not have enough data to estimate it. If your irregularity pie chart is missing, there are probably gaps in the graphs. You can consider <</sleep/automatic_sleep_tracking#, Automatic tracking start>> or <</sleep/sleep_time_estimation#, Sleep time estimation>> features, if you often forget to start the tracking.
