If you forget to start sleep tracking we can use your phone activity recognition engine and try to estimate you sleep duration.

The next day, a pop-up notification with estimated timings appears.

Disabled:: No data from recognition engine are collected.
Manual only:: Sleep time estimation is saved only after you confirm it.
Save automatically:: Sleep time estimation is saved automatically when a tracking is missing the previous night.

== How it works

The sleep time suggestion feature is built on completely different basis than sleep tracking itself. Google provides an API (Google Activity Transition API or https://developers.google.com/location-context/sleep[Google Sleep API]), that tells us in which state your phone has been at different times - and we use that currently experimentally to try to assess your sleep time if you weren't tracking.

NOTE: This feature requires at least 500 events in sensor batching queue. If you don't see Sleep time estimation listed in the Settings, than your phone does not meet this criteria.
