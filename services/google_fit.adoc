Allows you to synchronize data between Sleep as Android and Google Fit.

_Settings -> Services -> Google Fit_

== Features

* Upload your sleep data into Google Fit
* Download 3rd party sleep data from Google Fit into Sleep as Android
* Heart rate import and export
* Automatic synchronization of the *#sport* tag based on your fitness activity recorded in Google Fit

NOTE: When enabling the integration, you are asked whether you'd like to synchronize your past records. This is currently limited up to 3 years. All new sleep records are then synchronized with Fit.

[WARNING]
The app will only sync entries without cloud icon (that were already synced from another cloud service).

== Sync methods

[horizntal]
Normal sync::
Saves data for the past 2 weeks. Happens everytime sleep tracking ends, or when you create a sleep record manually. Also everytime you start the app, if a sync did not happen in the past 24 hours.
Full sync::
Saves data for the past 3 years. Can be triggered from _Settings -> Services -> Google Fit_ (you have to toggle off and on) -> Upload_ (button in the lower right corner)

NOTE: Heart rate data are saved only for the past 7 days in both normal and full sync (they are computationally intensive).

NOTE: The *#sport* tag is added when at least 80% of the goal (Steps or Heart points) is achieved during the day.
