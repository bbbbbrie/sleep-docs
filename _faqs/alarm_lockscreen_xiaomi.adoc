.In general, all new Android versions

Google has made it impossible to launch screens from the background in newer Android versions. Because of this, we can no longer show the alarm screen with the big buttons in the usual settings. The app can only show notifications in the background if the screen is on when the alarm starts. If the screen is locked, we can usually show the full screen alarm.

. Go to _Settings -> Alarms -> Fullscreen alarm_ (may be hidden under Advanced in the Snooze/Dismiss section), and enable this option.
. This will take you to the System Preferences where you will need to give the *Draw/Display over other apps* permission.


.XiaoMi / MIUI
On Xiaomi/MIUI, you need to give special permission to Sleep as Android to unlock your screen during an alarm.

. Go to System _Settings -> Permissions -> Advanced Permissions -> select Sleep app and give it permission to access the lock screen.


NOTE: If you are using a CAPTCHA task from the CAPTCHA add-on, please make sure that the permission is also given to the add-on.


.Samsung
When the alarm goes off, it does not disable the lock screen and you will need to manually unlock the device to tap snooze or dismiss.

You may have Sleep as Android enabled under Edge Lighting (Edge Lighting on some versions). This causes the alarm popup not to appear above the lock screen because the notification appears as a light around the edge of the screen.

. Disable Border lights for Sleep as Android in your deviceâ€™s settings.
