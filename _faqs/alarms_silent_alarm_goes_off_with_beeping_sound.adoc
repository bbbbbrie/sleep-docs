Battery optimization has been enabled:::
- When battery optimization is enabled, vibrations do not work, so the app loads the built-in ringtone to make sure you wake up.
. Check _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Battery optimized_.
. Do not enable *Save battery* option from the _Tracking screen -> Stop and save pull up menu -> Save battery_.

Phone has been restarted::
- If the phone screen is locked after a restart, the app cannot load any files.
- The phone will ring with the built-in ringtone and vibrate.
