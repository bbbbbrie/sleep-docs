- If there are too many awakenings falsely estimated on your graph, use the _Left_ â˜° menu -> icon:ic_help_q[] Support ->icon:ic_bug[] Report a bug, and send us the application log.
- Most often the awakes are driven by significant HR peaks (awakes align with HR red line graph), you can try to disable this type of awake detection in _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Awake detection -> Heart rate monitoring_.
- Another common cause is phone screen turned on, you can try disabling the Awake when using phone awake detection in _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Awake detection -> Awake when using phone_.
