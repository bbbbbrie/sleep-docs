- Garmin watches have a system-wide _gesture backlight_ setting that lights up your screen on wrist move, when you move your wrist while running an application. By default, this setting is ON.
. Go to *Settings/System/Lighting/During Activity/Gesture* and turn it off. Now the light will not come on when you run or bike and turn your wrist. Make sure it's still on for buttons and alarms so that it turns on when you need it during exercise.

- Fenix 6: It may be possible to set a power mode / power profile in the power manager so that the backlight doesn't only light up in the sleep app.
