All currently supported devices can be found at <</devices/supported_wearable#, list of compatible devices>>.

If you'd like us to integrate another device, please submit it as a suggestion to our https://forum.urbandroid.org/c/feature-requests/integration-requests[Suggestion Forum]. Also, please check if the device has an API so we can integrate it.
