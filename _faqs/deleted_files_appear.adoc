If you delete the graph from the Sleep app and it comes back later, check if the graph has icon:ic_cloud_upload[] icon. These graphs are synced from an external service - either Samsung Health, Health Connect, or Google Fit.

If you delete the graphs there too, the they won't reappear in the Sleep when you delete them.
