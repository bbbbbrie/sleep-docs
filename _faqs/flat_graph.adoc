There are several reasons why your graphs may be flat.

.The actigraphy is almost flat
If you can see some movement on the actigraphy, but the graph is unusually flat:
. *Sonar* - make sure the signal is strong enough by keeping the sonar volume at max at _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Test sensor -> blue sliding bar_.
- You can also try a different frequency by selecting other frequency from the drop-down menu list in _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Test sensor -> Frequency_
- Keep the phone closer to your bed.
- Try different positions of the phone.
. *Accelerometer* - try keeping the phone closer to you.

.The actigraphy is flat, or red
- Disable all system restrictions applied to Sleep as Android, or any companion app for tracking with a wearable: https://dontkillmyapp.com/
