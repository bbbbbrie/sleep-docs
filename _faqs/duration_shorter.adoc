Sleep duration is the sum of all your sleep stages (light, REM, and deep), not including waking stages - because you are not really sleeping when you are awake.
So on default settings, your Sleep Duration ,ay be a little shorter than your tracking time.

If you want your sleep duration to be the same as your tracking duration:

* Disable the awake detection in _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Awake detection_.
* You can also try to adjust the sensitivity of each type of settings to get optimal results. In most cases, too many awake periods are caused by significant HR peaks.
* If you are not sure, where these awake periods are coming from, please use the _Left_ â˜° menu -> icon:ic_help_q[] Support ->icon:ic_bug[] Report a bug, and send us the application log.
