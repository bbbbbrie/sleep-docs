We roll out the latest features to beta testers first to maintain a good experience for regular users who are not so keen on new features but prefer things to be as stable as possible.

. Please first join our BETA Testers group at:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sleep-as-an-droid
. That you can opt-into the BETA at the following address:
https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.urbandroid.sleep
or by visiting our Play Store listing and tapping "Join BETA"

NOTE: Without joining the Tester group, you cannot opt-in!

You should then receive latest BETA updates via the Play Store.

To discuss BETA channel related issues please use our forum at: https://forum.urbandroid.org/c/beta

We would love to have you join the community and give us feedback on the latest features.
