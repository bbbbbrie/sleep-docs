WARNING: When tracking with sonar, the volume must be kept at maximum to maintain reliable results.

Unfortunately, this also affects media volume in third-party applications, and we cannot control those separately from Sonar's media volume. This means that while using Sonar, you can only use media applications at full volume.

You can set a time delay to start tracking in _Settings -> Sleep Tracking -> Awake Detection -> Delayed Sleep Tracking_.

External Players::
When using Sonar, you cannot use the volume buttons to control the media volume because it always jumps back to maximum.


Lullabies::
You can control the volume of lullabies from the Sleep app (_Settings -> Lullabies_) and from https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep.addon.lullaby[Lullaby add-on pack] - when you lower the volume with the volume buttons, the lullaby volume is estimated and adjusted accordingly, the Sonar volume is still kept at maximum.
