Threshold volume is set too high, so only very loud sounds meet the criteria for recording, and only a few will trigger the recorder.

. Go to _Settings -> Sleep noise analysis -> Recording volume threshold_
. Lower the threshold with the slider (optimal value that works in most environments is between 15-25%).
