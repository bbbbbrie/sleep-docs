We have had reports of audible artifacts during sonar tracking on some devices. It sounds like this:

audio::/assets/audios/sonar.mp3[options="controls"]

Some of the signal gets into the audible range, probably due to either insufficient speaker quality or some post-processing applied to the output by your device's firmware.

We also have some reports that Sonar can suddenly become audible while tracking at night. Unfortunately, we are not sure why this might happen, we have very few such reports, and we are not able to reproduce this on our phones.

To make any audible artifacts less likely:

. Go to _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Test Sensor_.
. Try a different frequency from the drop-down menu list.
. When you find the least affected frequency, you can  try lowering the volume a bit (the slider). But keep it as high as possible to get reliable results.

NOTE: If the volume needs to be adjusted, always confirm that sonar is still working - ideally after you change settings, try to sit calm in font of the test for few seconds and than move slightly -  do you see a spike?
