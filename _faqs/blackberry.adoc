Sleep as Android is not officially supported on Blackberry. However, many users have reported running it without any problems.

A common problem is when you try to unlock Sleep as Android. You won't be able to install the "Sleep as Android Unlock" app from the Play Store. A working solution is to buy the unlock and then send us a proof of purchase and application log (use _Left_ â˜° menu -> (?) Support -> icon:ic_bug[] Report a bug). We'll unlock the application specifically for your phone.
