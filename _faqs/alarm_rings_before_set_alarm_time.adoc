- Smart alarm is enabled (see <</alarms/smart_wake_up#,Smart wake up>>), so the app is waking you within the smart period, when light sleep is estimated.
- If this is not what you expect, disable smart period altogether, or try a shorter smart period.
- Go to _Settings -> Alarms -> Smart wakeup -> Smart period_ for all your alarms, or for one alarm in _alarm -> Smart period_.
- The shortest period is 5 minutes, the longest is 2 hours.
