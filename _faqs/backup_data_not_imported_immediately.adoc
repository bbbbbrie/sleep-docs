title: Manual backup - cannot import data on my new phone

tags:

If you moved a `sleep-export.zip` file to your new phone and did not import the file before the app created a new sleep record, the app has replaced your `sleep-export.zip`. The old `sleep-export.zip` file has been renamed to `sleep-export.backup.zip`.

To restore the old data:

. Delete the `sleep-export.zip` file.
. Rename `sleep-export.backup.zip` to `sleep-export.zip`.

In Sleep, do _Left_ â˜° _menu -> icon:ic_cloud_upload[]  Backup > Import data_.
