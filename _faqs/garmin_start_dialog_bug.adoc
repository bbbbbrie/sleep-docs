title: Garmin - Cannot accept start dialog (green tick)

This dialog is the only way to start a watch app from the phone. Unfortunately, there's no way to do it without this dialog.

However, there is a bug in the Garmin firmware that breaks this dialog on Vivoactive watches.

In this case, please don't start sleep tracking from the phone.
As a workaround, start sleep tracking from the watch (just start the app on the watch and it will trigger sleep tracking on the phone).
