If you notice your volume gradually dropping after a while while tracking is running, the *Turn off when sleeping* is enabled. This feature lowers the system-wide volume, so it also affects music played outside of Sleep.

. Go to _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Lullabies -> Turn off when sleeping_.
. Increase the minimum play time (5-90 minutes).
. Or disable the feature altogether by setting it to *Disabled*, and the app won't change the volume.
