You can turn off an alarm before it goes off if you wake up naturally before the alarm goes off.

. *From the notification* - 1 hour before the alarm time, the "Before alarm notification" will appear in your notification bar; expand the notification and select "Dismiss".

. *From the tracking graph* - if you stop tracking, you can dismiss the alarm directly from the Morning screen.

. *From the main screen* - long press on the alarm card, and select "Skip next".

NOTE: None of these options will affect future alarms - if you have a repeating alarm, it will go off at the next scheduled time.
