- Most likely, your <</alarms/backup#,Backup alarm>> went off after your regular alarm failed tp wake you up. T Backup alarm is triggered when there is no interaction (no snooze, no dismiss) for more than 20 minutes.

- Make sure you are using a loud enough volume in the system settings. If you are using a current system volume, you risk the volume won't be suitable for you when the alarm starts. Any app can change this volume.
- Enable Gentle Volume in _Settings -> Alarms -> Gentle wake up -> Gentle volume_
- Try vibrations (_Settings -> Alarms -> -> Gentle wake up -> Vibrate_).
