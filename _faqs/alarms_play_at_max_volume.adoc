- Most likely, your <</alarms/backup#,Backup alarm>> went off after your regular alarm failed tp wake you up. T Backup alarm is triggered when there is no interaction (no snooze, no dismiss) for more than 20 minutes.

- Make sure you are using a loud enough volume in _Settings -> Alarms -> Ringtone_, or enable Gentle Volume in _Settings -> Alarms -> Gentle volume_
- Try vibrations (_Settings -> Alarms -> Vibrate_).
