The first food thing to have is *auto-delete*, which will automatically delete your noises  after one week. This is enabled by default in _Settings -> Sleep noise analysis -> Automatic delete_ (may be hidden in the Advanced section).

. Go to the _Left_ â˜° _menu -> icon:ic_action_noise[] Noise
. Long press on one of the recordings and use *Delete all unstarred recordings*.

Also, if you get too much noise recorded during the night, you can consider a higher recording threshold in _Settings -> Sleep noise analysis -> Recording volume threshold_.
