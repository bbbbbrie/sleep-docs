- When multiple alarms are created close together, they might overlap each other.
- If you created more alarms to make sure you are waken up, please note, that the app has a <</alarms/backup#,Backup alarm>> feature to make sure you are waken up.
- You can limit snoozing, and configure <</alarms/captcha#,CAPTCHA task>> to prove you are already fully woken up.
