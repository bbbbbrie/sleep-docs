Smart Bluetooth allows us to collect HR data from a non-compatible wearables, or oximeters.

. Enable the tracking in _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Wearables ->Bluetooth Smart_ (may be hidden in the Advanced section).
. Try pairing with your device (this may not be necessary for all devices and OS versions).
. Make sure that no other app is using your device during sleep tracking.

If nothing helps please send us a debug report using _Left_ â˜° menu -> icon:ic_help_q[] Support ->icon:ic_bug[] Report a bug..

NOTE: BT Smart heart rate tracking only works from Android 4.3 onward
