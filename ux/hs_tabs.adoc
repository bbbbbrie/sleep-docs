*Tabs home screen* shows different screens in Tabs - easily accessible and editable.

The tabs available can be edited, so you can hide the ones you don't use. The tabs showing will be hidden from the <</ux/left_menu#,Left ☰ menu>>. Alarms tab is always visible.

NOTE: The app remembers where you left the app the last time - and this tab will be shown as the first screen the next time you open the app again.
