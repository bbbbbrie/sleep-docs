Polyphasic sleep is the practice of sleeping in several shorter periods over the course of 24 hours (as opposed to the more common monophasic sleep with one long period of sleep).
This type of sleep practice requires some special settings.

The *Bedtime Notification* is normally scheduled based on the alarm time and the daily sleep income. Polyphasic sleep naps require a bedtime notification that is not based on the daily amount of sleep, but on the amount of sleep specific to that nap.
This target sleep duration can be set in the per-alarm setting, where you can select the length of sleep duration for the alarm and also adjust the bedtime notification time.

NOTE: The per-alarm sleep goal does not affect your daily sleep income, because you still need to reach the sum of sleep and naps each day.

. Open per-alarm settings from _Left_ â˜° _menu_ -> _Alarms_, and select the alarm you need to adjust.
. Tap the Bedtime notification tile and uncheck the Application settings (checked by default).
. Choose the sleep duration goal (20 minutes - 13 hours and 30 minutes) with the slider or from the drop-down menu list.
. Adjust the timing for the bedtime notification, if necessary.
. Confirm with the Save button at the bottom.
