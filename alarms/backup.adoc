== Backup alarm duration
Set how long the backup alarm will ring (it will then snooze for your default _Snooze Time_, but never less than 10 minutes).

== Ringtone
Backup alarm ringtone.

=== How to disable backup alarm [[backup_disable]]

. Go to _Settings -> Alarm default settings -> Back up -> Sound_.
. Set the ringtone to _Silent_.

NOTE: Silent ringtone for backup alarm won't disable vibrations. The backup alarm is the last thing to let you know that the alarm is still going off, so you can react and not fall asleep.

== Alarm timeout [[alarm-timeout]]
Time after which the backup alarm will ring if you ignore your normal alarm.

== Repeat
Maximum number of times the alarm can be repeated. After that, no alarm will ring.


[EXAMPLE]
====
Alarm time: 7:00
Backup alarm duration: 2 minutes
Alarm timeout: 10 minutes
This is what happens if you don't interact with the alarm:

- 7:00 – alarm starts
- 7:10 – backup alarm starts (full volume, duration 2 minutes)
- 7:12 – automatically snoozes (for 10 minutes, as your default snooze time is 10 minutes)
- 7:22 – backup alarm starts again

…and so on, based on the number of repetitions.
