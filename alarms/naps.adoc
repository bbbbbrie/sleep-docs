*Schedule an alarm to go off _after_ a certain amount of time instead of _at_ a certain hour and minute.*

[EXAMPLE]
Instead of setting the alarm to go off at 7 a.m., you can set it to go off in 15 minutes.

Add a new alarm with icon:ic_alarm_plus[] -> NAP button. You can choose naps from 1 minute to 10 hours.

NOTE: By default, nap alarms are deleted after they go off, but you can uncheck the <</alarms/alarm_settings#alarm_delete, Delete after ringing>> option in Alarm settings.
