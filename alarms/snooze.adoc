*Snooze will delay your wake up if you do not feel rested at alarm time.*

After hitting a snooze button on the alarm screen, you get an additional period of sleep, and the alarm time is postponed.
You can also limit snoozing in several ways to prevent oversleeping.

_Settings -> Alarms -> Snooze_
_Alarm-specific settings_

[EXAMPLE]
The alarm goes off at 5:30, and it wakes you up at 5:33.
But you decide to have some more sleep for a few minutes and you hit the 10 snooze button.
The alarm goes off again at 5:43 (5:33 + 10 minutes snooze).
