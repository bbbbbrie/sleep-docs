*Sends you a "Time to go to bed!" notification before bedtime.*

Bedtime notification is an effective way to maintain optimal sleep duration or to combat sleep deficit. You can set the alert to go off anywhere from 5 minutes to 2 hours before bedtime, so you'll have plenty of time to get ready for bed.

_Settings -> Alarms -> Bedtime notification_
_per-alarm settings -> Bedtime notification_

NOTE: The time of your bedtime is calculated as follows:
`bedtime = next alarm time – daily sleep duration goal`
[EXAMPLE]
You have set your <<duration_goal,Daily sleep duration goal>> to 7 hours, and an alarm for 6 AM.
Your bedtime would be 11 PM.

== Bedtime notification
Enable bedtime notification and set how long before bedtime you want to receive them.

== Sleep duration goal [[duration_goal]]
Daily sleep duration goal is your target sleep duration - how much time would you ideally want to sleep each night.

Daily sleep duration is influenced by:

- <</alarms/bedtime_notification#,bedtime notification>>
- counting of your <</sleep/charts#deficit,sleep deficit>>


The ideal daily amount of sleep for healthy adults is 7-9 hours, according to link:https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/how-many-hours-of-sleep-are-enough/faq-20057898[Mayo Clinic].

In the app the sleep score uses your age (if provided in  _Settings -> Stats_) to adjust the ideal sleep times for the <</sleep/sleepscore#, Sleep score>> stats.


[horizontal]
General:: 6.5 - 9 hours
School age:: 9 - 11 hours
Teenager:: 8 - 10 hours
Young:: 7 - 9 hours
Elderly:: 6 - 9 hours

NOTE: For biphasic and polyphasic sleep goals of individual naps, see the <</alarms/polyphasic#,Polyphasic sleeping schedule>> chapter.

== Repeat
How often to repeat the notification.

[EXAMPLE]
10 Minutes Repeat will notify you once at notification time and then every 10 minutes until you dismiss the notification away or start sleep tracking.

== Smart bedtime

When enabled, Smart Bedtime adjusts the notification time based on your sleep loss over the past 5 days, the average length of the Smart Wake period, and the default pause time at the start of sleep tracking. The exact formula is

[EXAMPLE]
smart time to bed = next alarm – daily sleep duration goal – smart period – delayed tracking – in(5 days average sleep deficit > 10 min, 45 min)


== Per-alarm bedtime notification
A special case of bedtime notifications for polyphasic sleeping schedules (see <</alarms/polyphasic#,Polyphasic sleeping schedule>>).
